This is my PP3 Python project for my Diploma in Full Stack software development at Code Institute.

This is a quiz based application created with Python.

This is a multiple choice quiz. with a main menu, Rules option, and Exit option randomised questions and answers to keep repeat users playing.

## Target Audience.

Anyone that would like to test the knowledge on the Harry Potter films

## User Stories.

A site for someone to test there general knowledge in Harry Potter.

A representation of how the basis of Python works , easy to visualise the code for new coders,variables to functions, to different scopes.

## Design.

### General Structure.
This is back End code displayed in a mock terminal provided by Heroku 

### Wire Frame.

as this is back end development a wire frame would not suite this application 

## Features.

Randomising of questions and answers to make the quiz less repetitive 
the score is tallied up through a function that is displayed at the end of the quiz.

### Testing.

  - Test was done before deployment to see if everything in the terminal was acting correctly.
  - While hosting on Heroku, multiple OS were used to test the functionality of the quiz. such as macOS and Windows 
  - all imports are working.

  ### Bugs.

  - I came across no major bugs while testing. 
  - just a spacing problem that was caused by the incorrect placement of '\n'
  - and a problem with the quiz restarting at question 11 instead of question 1 with a quiz restart
  
  ### Validator Testing.

  
 ### Technologies and Languages used.
